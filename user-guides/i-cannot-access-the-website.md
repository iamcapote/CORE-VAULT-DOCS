# I cannot access the website

{% embed url="https://www.cvault.finance/" %}

The Website cVault.Finance was moved from [cVault.Finance](https://cvault.finance) to [COREFINANCE.ETH](https://corefinance.eth) which is an [ENS address](https://ens.domains/). In short this is an NFT that holds information, in our case a direct [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/) link to the website. \


IPFS works by using a different system that normal browsers are not used to but if you have a crypto compatible browser or app the solution is simple as you need to enable it in the settings.\

{% hint style="danger" %}
Alternatively you can use [https://corevault.eth.limo](https://corevault.eth.limo/) or [https://corevault.eth.link](https://corevault.eth.link/) . But this leaves you vulnerable from hacks that involve changing the DNS site to a compromised one therefore this is not the recommended way of connecting to the website. Always make sure that you check the contracts that you are interacting with before interacting with them.
