coreDAO tokens can be staked in the vault in order to farm [CORE](core/). Each CORE traded incurs a **Fee-of-Transfer** **(FoT)** of 1% that is transferred to coreDAO staked in the [CORE vault](core-vault.md). The staking contracts are built intelligently to save gas and every time coreDAO is unstaked you claim your rewards automatically.

CORE Finance aims to become a self-sustaining project with an emphasis on decentralization and community thus coreDAO holders can participate in **on-chain** votes on platform decisions. They can vote on **CORE Improvement Proposals (CIP)** and direct the future of the platform. On the other hand, users that have active loans in coreDAO cannot participate in governance.

Initially, locked liquidity was gathered through **Liquidity Generation Events (LGEs)** that minted LP tokens composed of CORE paired with ETH, BTC, and DAI. This liquidity was eventually converted into DAI and CORE pairs to form coreDAO. This conversion along with **locked liquidity** allows coreDAO to have a **loan value** in DAI just like with CORE.

Normally, LP tokens provide liquidity which can be removed at any time. Tokens like coreDAO are much more than that because they **validate locked liquidity** that cannot be removed and at the same time are rewarded with farming, lending and governance.
