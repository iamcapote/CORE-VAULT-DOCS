CORE has a **limited supply** of 10,000 tokens. This limit causes actions inside the ecosystem to have a **deflationary effect** on the supply of the token and in turn affect the entire network. Additionally, the protocol has burned more than 80% of the total supply bringing the **circulating supply** close to \~1602 tokens.

The ecosystem is built in such a way that every token transfer incurs a 1% **Fee of Transfer (FoT)**. FoT is a mechanism by which every time a token is moved from one address to another, a percentage from the tokens (FoT) is directed to the protocol. This FoT is split between two agents of the system: **93%** of this fee goes to the staked coreDAO holders and **7%** goes to the protocol-owned treasury.

Automated Market Makers (AMM) like Uniswap that take a 0.3% trading fee for LP holders along with the **FoT** increase the **Total Value Permanently Locked (TVPL) of the entire system.**

Furthermore the liquidity of the ecosystem is **permanently locked** meaning that liquidity pool tokens cannot be broken into their underlying tokens. Locked liquidity empowers CORE to have a **floor price**, which enables lending and other products. The floor price of a token is a minimum amount of DAI that this token can be redeem for at any time (e.g., one Core token is redeemable for its floor value via cLend at any time). Users can decide to loan out their CORE for DAI with the option of paying it back or running the risk of liquidation which burns their collateral. Different types of collateral are open for addition by DAO governance proposals.

The architecture of the CORE network creates several **compounding loops** inside its ecosystem that directly _affect the valuation of the whole ecosystem_.
