# LGEs

Liquidity Generation Events (LGEs) were how the original CORE team kickstarted the initial distribution of the [CORE Token](core/) and the **locked liquidity** that powers the entire CORE Finance ecosystem.

LGEs are a fair way to distribute a token and provide liquidity without giving developer bonuses or shares.

An LGE uses a smart contract which collects a variety of tokens during a determined period. After the timer is over the contract uses the collected funds to **create a new liquidity pool**. Participants who contributed tokens to the LGE smart contract will **receive LP tokens** after the LGE event is over.

Contributing funds to an LGE gives participants the ability to receive **discounted LP tokens** for the reason that they are all created at the same time. During this event the price per LP token does not scale. It is even for all contributors. After the event is over the price will scale along with the pool, meaning it will become increasingly expensive for each new minted LP token.
