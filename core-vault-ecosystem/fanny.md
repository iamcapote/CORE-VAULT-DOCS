A total of **300 FANNY** tokens were minted, each representing one real life limited-edition Fanny Pack. **25 Fanny tokens** were airdropped to selected contributors and early supporters of the ecosystem. **100 FANNY** tokens can be farmed for 30 days by staking CORE on our platform. Additionally, farmers could increase their yield by locking up CORE for a specific amount of time or burning it. The remaining **175 FANNY** tokens will be deposited into a Uniswap liquidity pool together with [CORE](core/). The price of the merchandise is dictated by supply and demand of the pool.

This product allowed not only a merchandise token but paved the way for more innovative products in the network.
