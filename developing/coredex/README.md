CORE Finance is developing **coreDEX** which is a _next-generation Automated Market Maker (AMM)_ which relies on **Future LP tokens** and more innovative solutions. This product aims to create a market inside of [CORE](../../core-vault-ecosystem/core/) under which users can buy and trade their upside from farming.

In order to create a premium product new ways of collecting and processing data were needed so CORE made a token standard that surpasses the capabilities of the ERC-20. Analyzing the ERC-20 standard, revealed its deficiency to collect information thus CORE improved on this by creating the [ERC-95](../../core-vault-ecosystem/core/erc-95.md). The newly developed ERC-95 standard proposal allows wrapped tokens to keep track of volume adjusted pricing, on chain. The major difference between CORE and other token standards lies in the fact that **this system collects data live** from the blockchain that is **trustless** because of the incredible cost that manipulation implies.

The competitive landscape heavily relies on _centralized oracles_ to provide data about liquidity and volume creating a gap that is _inefficient, can be susceptible to exploitation and prone to error._ The goal is to establish an environment rich in information which can be used to react to different market changes and power the future decentralized on-chain economy.

CORE is well positioned to adopt and improve on all other yield generating mechanisms in DeFi with on-chain data-supremacy, and with the feedback loops & networking effects of our ecosystem.
