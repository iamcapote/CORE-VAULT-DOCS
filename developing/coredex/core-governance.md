# CORE Governance

The CORE Ecosystem is designed from the ground up to involve community governance to decide everything, from developer fees, to decide on the fee approver contract, adding new pools, rebalancing, and even disabling pools in the CORE Transfer contract.&#x20;

The governance model is designed to be the strongest and most involved in DeFi because LP tokens are locked in indefinitely promoting active participation.

More information about this when private developer milestones are completed.\
